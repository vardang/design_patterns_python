It describes the problem and a general approach to solve it.

"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to the problem"

Design patterns ensure that our work is consistent, reliable and understandable

# SOLID
S - Single responsibility - a class should have only one responsibility
O - Open-closed - a class should be open for extension (by inherintance) but closed for modification
L - Liskov substitution - subclasses should be able to stand in for their parents in a program without breaking anything
I - Interface segregation - many specific interfaces are better than one "do it all" interface
D - Dependency inversion - we should programm towards abstractions, not implementations. Implementations can vary, abstractions should not
